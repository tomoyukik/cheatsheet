### safari速度改善

> - Check for software updates from Apple.
> - In Safari Preferences, choose to open tabs, not with the Top Sites but a blank page.
> - Clean the entire history (cache, cookies, …) or do a Safari reset.
> - Try to update Adobe Flash Player to the latest version or disable Flash. If you need to enable Flash, you can install a special extension for Safari, which allows you to watch the necessary video from Adobe Flash.
> - Clean up unnecessary Internet Plugins. The plugins are located in the Library folder. Some plugins can slow down Safari, especially the old ones which are not supported and do not work correctly with the latest version of the browser.

> - Slow browser performance and freezing can occur because of the additionally installed applications, for example, 1Password.
> - Set up the browser history to be saved no more than necessary. Some users save history no more than a week.
> - Re-login to iCloud. It seems to be a waste of time, however, it can positively affect the applications if they use the service of cloud storage. For example, Safari stores your saved logins and passwords in iCloud, so that they become available on all your gadgets. Go to the System Preferences → iCloud section → logout → reboot your Mac → and log in again. Wait for the synchronization of all your data and check to see if the browser problems still exist.

> - Try to create a new Mac user profile and check how Safari works.

> - Check the memory usage of extensions. In the Chrome menu select More tools → Task Manager. You will see the browser’s Task Manager window. Here you can see a list of extensions or tabs and the memory usage of each of them. Some extensions may work incorrectly and use a significant amount of RAM.

> - Add an advertisement blocking extension. Today, there are many advertising sites which show many banners. These banners are big and mostly are animated. If there are many banners on a web page, they can significantly slow down your browser. To speed up Chrome, you can try to disable advertising. To do this, use a special AdBlock extension. It allows you to block almost all ads on websites and work without distraction. You can add a part of the sites to the whitelist, which will display all advertising and non-advertising banners.

> - Clear browser data.

> - Delete the unwanted start page in the shortcut properties. For this, go to the Chrome Preferences.
> - Update the software to the latest version. All software pre-installed on your Mac, including the Chrome browser, should be up-to-date. Automatically checking for new updates works with a fairly long delay, so we recommend checking them manually.
